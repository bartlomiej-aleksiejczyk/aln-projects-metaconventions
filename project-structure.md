# Project structure conventions

- Use `documentation` directory in root as main directory for documentation.
- Use `documentation/project-design` for all conceptual tasks.
- Use `documentation/project-design/todo.md` for storing all concrete things that should be done.
- Use `documentation/project-design/vision.md` for more vague ideas/requirements/wishes.
